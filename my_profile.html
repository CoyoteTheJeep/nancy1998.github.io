        <p>Hi my name is Nancy. I'm a girl who codes at Adobe. I got introduced to coding by a family friend who taught me and my sister on Python. At Girls Who Code we learned different types of languages (coding has different languages!). I have to admit some of the languages that we learned were pretty tough but with the help of the teachers, the TAs, my classmates I got the hang of it.</p>
